<VideoPlayer embedId="nsNedk1Z3Pg" />

## Overview

Spheron is revolutionizing the way you utilize your GPU resources by connecting them to a decentralized network. Spheron allows you to easily lease powerful GPU resources from a vast network of providers worldwide. With Spheron, underutilized GPU hardware can now become a valuable asset, enabling providers to monetize their idle resources while ensuring maximum utilization. 

Our unique Decentralized Compute Network (DCN) connects GPU suppliers with those requiring additional computing power, creating an efficient, secure, and seamless ecosystem. **It features an Onchain Supply Market for trading and allocating resources, a transparent economy powered by a native token system, and leverages the Arbitrum Layer 2 chain for scalability and efficiency. Key components include Provider Nodes that contribute compute resources, a Matchmaking Engine for allocating requests, and a Payment System for secure and transparent transactions. The DCN intelligently manages resource allocation, ensuring optimal performance and longevity for all participating GPUs – so everyone benefits!**

By becoming a part of the Spheron network, GPU hardware providers gain access to a diverse marketplace where they can offer their surplus capacity, earning extra income effortlessly. Meanwhile, users looking to harness GPU-accelerated computation will find Spheron's extensive pool of readily available GPU resources ideal for applications such as machine learning, scientific simulations, CGI rendering, blockchain computations, and much more.
