# Coupon Credits

You can use coupon credits for various purposes, including upgrading plans, adding add-ons, and topping up compute credits.
Follow these steps to add Coupon Credits:

1. Navigate to the "Coupon Credits" section under the **Billing** tab.
2. Click "Add Credit".
3. Enter the credit coupon code, complete the CAPTCHA verification and Click "Redeem Credit".
4. You can view the status of all your credits here, categorized as Active, Pending, and Expired.

In scenarios where a user possesses both Spheron and Referral credits, our system simplifies the experience
by representing them as one cohesive payment method. To prioritize and optimize the utilization of credits,
referral credits will be exhausted before tapping into the Spheron Credits during any transaction.

  **NOTE:** <br /> It's pivotal to remember that while credits can be spread
  across numerous organizations, they all draw from a singular, unified credit
  pool.
